# SCARV-related UG, PGR, and PhD thesis archive

<!--- -------------------------------------------------------------------- --->

*The
[SCARV](https://www.scarv.org)
project
is hosted within the
[Department of Computer Science](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/departments/computerscience)
at the
[University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk),
and, as such, has supported a number of associated
undergraduate          (e.g., BSc and MEng),
post-graduate taught   (i.e., MSc),
and
post-graduate research (i.e., PhD)
projects.  Some such projects align with a core activity 
within SCARV, others explore something at the periphery; 
either way this repository is an archive of their output,
namely the PDF-format
[thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis#United_Kingdom)
produced in each case.*

[Git Large File Storage (LFS)](http://git-lfs.github.com/):
it makes sense to install this first, otherwise that content appears
as a set of pointers to data vs. the data itself.
